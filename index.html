      <p>Australia is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. Due to its rich number of animal species, our team was curious as to what animal testing occurs in Australia and why. When a state in this visualization is clicked on, a pie chart for that state for each of the following topics of animal testing will appear: Types of animals tested on, purposes of testing, and severities of testing. The first pie chart displays the number of each animal tested on. The next pie chart shows the number of animals used for different testing purposes. The final pie chart shows the number of animals used for the different types of testing severity. All of the data is from the year 2017. This visualization not only makes it easy to compare animal testing between each state in Australia, but also gives a richer picture of why countries decide to test on animals. </p>
